    "#Advantages of Multiple Inheritance: Increased Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit functionalities from\n",

    "# Definition: A derived class, also known as a subclass or child class, is a class that inherits properties and behaviors from a\n",
    "# base class.\n",
    "# Role: It extends or specializes the functionality of the base class by inheriting its attributes and methods while potentially\n",
    "# adding new ones or modifying existing ones.\n",
    "# Characteristics: A derived class inherits all non-private members (attributes and methods) from its base class and can\n",
