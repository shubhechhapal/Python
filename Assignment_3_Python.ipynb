    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Ans. Modularity: Functions allow you to break down a complex program into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each function can\n",
    "#focus on a specific task or functionality.\n",
    "# Code Reusability: Once you define a function, you can reuse it in different parts of your program or even in other projects.\n",
    "# This promotes a more efficient and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding approach.\n",
    "# Readability: Functions enhance the readability of your code by abstracting away the details of a particular operation. A well-\n",
    "#named function can serve as documentation, describing its purpose and functionality.\n",
    "# Ease of Debugging:Functions help in isolating errors or bugs to specific parts of your code. When a function is not working as\n",
    "#expected, you can focus on that particular function without dealing with the entire program.\n",
    "#bScoping: Functions define their own scope, which helps in avoiding naming conflicts between variables in different parts of\n",
    "#the program. This enhances code reliability and reduces the likelihood of unintended side effects.\n",
    "#Abstraction: Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing you to use high-level operations without worrying about the\n",
    "#details of the implementation. This makes the code more user-friendly and hides complexity when it's not necessary to expose it.\n",
    "#Testing: Functions make it easier to write and conduct unit tests. You can test each function individually, ensuring that\n",
    "#specific components of your program work correctly before integrating them into the whole.\n",
    "#Collaboration: In a team environment, functions facilitate collaboration by allowing team members to work on different\n",
    "#functions simultaneously. As long as the function interfaces are well-defined, team members can integrate their work more\n",
    "#easily.\n",
    "#Code Organization:Functions contribute to a well-organized code structure. A program with well-defined functions is typically\n",
    "#easier to navigate and understand than one with a monolithic structure."
